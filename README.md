The Test plan is created with FreeMind, and I exported as html file to allow you to see the map and the description for each test case.
I created six sections for the E2E tests, one for each flow.
I identified some test cases with priority 1, and these will be once that I will implement for the automated scripts.
For the cases I assume that:
- There is no specific password format
- At signup there is no email sent
